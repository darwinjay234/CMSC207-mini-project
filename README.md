# **Personal Website - Mini Project (CMSC 207)**  

## **Project Description**  
This is a simple website that provides information about me, my career, and my personal interests, such as hobbies.  

Please note that this is a **basic project**, so there may be some flaws. This website is solely for submitting a mini-project in **CMSC 207**.  

There are no special requirements or instructions for using itâ€”feel free to browse!  

## **Live Demo**  
ðŸ”— [Live Demo Link](https://darwinjay234.github.io/CMSC207-mini-project/) 

## **Navigation Menu**  
The navigation menu does **not work** on the live page because this is a static website. However, the intended logic is that when you hover your mouse over the navigation bar, it expands to reveal the complete menu.


## **Technologies Used**  
- **HTML** â€“ Structure of the webpage  
- **CSS** â€“ Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** â€“ Basic interactivity  

## **Future Improvements**  
âœ… Implement a fully functional navigation menu  
âœ… Add responsive design for mobile compatibility  
âœ… Improve CSS animations and transitions
